if you want to test, create a directory called 'testCases' and put images into it following this format:  
------- seqNum_Value.jpg -------  
where:  
seqNum -> sequence number of the image (or any uniqe id of the image you choose)  
Value -> the value of the image is the base3 number calculated from the image, manually
