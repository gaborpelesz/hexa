if you want to test, create a directory called 'testCases' and put images into it following this format:\n
------- seqNum_Value.jpg -------\n
where:\n
\tseqNum -> sequence number of the image (or any uniqe id of the image you choose)\n
\tValue -> the value of the image is the base3 number calculated from the image, manually\n
